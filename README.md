**explainy** is a library for generating machine learning models explanations in Python. It uses methods from **Machine Learning Explainability** and provides a standardized API to create feature importance explanations for samples. 

The API is inspired by `scikit-learn` and has three core methods `explain()`, `plot()` and, `importance()`. The explanations are generated in the form of texts and plots.

**explainy** comes with four different algorithms to create either *global* or *local* and *contrastive* or *non-contrastive* model explanations.


| Method				|Type | Explanations | Classification | Regression | 
| --- 				| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
|[Permutation Feature Importance](https://explainy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explainy.explanations.html#module-explainy.explanation.permutation_explanation)	| non-contrastive | global |  :star: | :star:|
|[Shap Values](https://explainy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explainy.explanations.html?highlight=shap#module-explainy.explanations.shap_explanation)		| non-contrastive | local |   	:star: | :star:|

|[Counterfactual Example](https://explainy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explainy.explanations.html#module-explainy.explanation.counterfactual_explanation)| contrastive | local |:star:| :star:|


Description:
- **global**: explanation of system functionality (all samples have the same explanation)
- **local**: explanation of decision rationale (each sample has its own explanation)
- **contrastive**: tracing of decision path (differences to other outcomes are described)
- **non-contrastive**: parameter weighting (the feature importance is reported)


## Documentation

## Install explainy

```
pip install explainy
```

## Usage

ðŸ“š A comprehensive example of the `explainy` API can be found in this ![Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MauroLuzzatto/explainy/blob/main/examples/01-explainy-intro.ipynb) 
 
ðŸ“– Or in the [example section](https://explainy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/01-explainy-intro.html) of the documentation


Initialize and train a `scikit-learn` model:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

diabetes = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    diabetes.data, diabetes.target, random_state=0
)
X_test = pd.DataFrame(X_test, columns=diabetes.feature_names)
y_test = pd.DataFrame(y_test)

model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Initialize the `PermutationExplanation` (or any other explanation) object and pass in the trained model and the to be explained dataset. 

Addtionally, define the number of features used in the explanation. This allows you to configure the verbosity of your exaplanation.

 Set the index of the sample that should be explained.

```python
from explainy.explanations import PermutationExplanation

number_of_features = 4

explainer = PermutationExplanation(
    X_test, y_test, model, number_of_features
)
```
Call the `explain()` method and print the explanation for the sample (in case of a local explanation every sample has a different explanation).

```python
explanation = explainer.explain(sample_index=1)
print(explanation)
```
> The RandomForestRegressor used 10 features to produce the predictions. The prediction of this sample was 251.8.

> The feature importance was calculated using the Permutation Feature Importance method.

> The four features which were most important for the predictions were (from highest to lowest): 'bmi' (0.15), 's5' (0.12), 'bp' (0.03), and 'age' (0.02).

Use the `plot()` method to create a feature importance plot of that sample.

```python
explainer.plot()
```
![Permutation Feature Importance](https://github.com/MauroLuzzatto/explainy/raw/main/static/permutation_importance.png)

If your prefer, you can also create another type of plot, as for example a boxplot.
```python
explainer.plot(kind='box')
```
![Permutation Feature Importance BoxPlot](https://github.com/MauroLuzzatto/explainy/raw/main/static/permutation_importance_box.png)


Finally, you can also look at the importance values of the features (in form of a `pd.DataFrame`).

```python
feature_importance = explainer.importance()
print(feature_importance)
```

```python
  Feature  Importance
0     bmi        0.15
1      s5        0.12
2      bp        0.03
3     age        0.02
4      s2       -0.00
5     sex       -0.00
6      s3       -0.00
7      s1       -0.01
8      s6       -0.01
9      s4       -0.01
```

<!-- Finally the result can be saved

```python
explainer.save(sample_index)
``` -->
